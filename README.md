## 🧠 What is Align [AIAdopts](https://www.aiadopts.com/)?

**Align AIAdopts** is a knowledge repository focused on **AI adoption as an operating and leadership decision**, not a tooling exercise.

It exists to address the real failure pattern inside enterprises:

> *AI capability increases — organizational conviction does not.*

This repository focuses on:
- Ownership before implementation  
- Decision rights before deployment  
- Alignment before scale
